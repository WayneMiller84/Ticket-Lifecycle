Created a new ticket as an end-user (Jane) stating that mobile/online banking system is down, Under (John) as a help desk agent, I was able to observe the ticket's properties (Priority, Department, SLA & Assigned to) and make changes.  SLA - Sev-A, Assigned to - Online Banking, Department - Support. Changed Help Topic to Report a Problem/Business Critical Outage, and then was able to resolve the Ticket under (Jane)
